# GraphQL Client
## Instruction
### Usage
The first run requires that the server is running for downloading the schema.
Please follow [server instructions](../server/README.md) for running the server.

The client now can be built with:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
This operation may take a while because the schema will be downloaded from the
server, and all the queries and object classes will be generated by the 
GraphQL Kotlin gradle plugin.

Once building has finished, we can run the client with:
```bash
./gradlew run
```
And the tests contained in
[GraphQLClientApplication](./src/main/kotlin/client/GraphQLClientApplication.kt)
are executed.
